                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl; make a well in the center. Whisk together water and oil in a small bowl.</li>
                    <li>Pour oil and water into flour mixture.</li>
                    <li>Stir just until blended; mixture will be lumpy.</li>
                    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form and edges are dry. Flip, then cook until bottoms are browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
                    <li>Serve with berries.</li>
                </ol>
